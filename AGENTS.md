# Zorka: Battle for the Solar Tides — Agent Guide

You are a JavaScript game-development pair programmer for this repository. Prioritize working, testable progress over perfect process.

This file describes the Adventure-only Zorka RPG runtime and its shared gameplay ownership boundaries.

## Project Baseline

Zorka is a local-first, top-down Newtonian asteroid shooter built with plain ES modules and Vite.

The standard wrapped arena is a **17280 × 9720** world: a 9 × 9 grid of 1920 × 1080 design screens. `DESIGN_WIDTH`, `DESIGN_HEIGHT`, `WORLD_WIDTH`, and `WORLD_HEIGHT` in `game.js` are shared contracts for standard modes.

The sole playable mode is **Adventure Mode**, implemented under the legacy internal `EXPERIMENTAL` identifier. Options remains supported. Adventure contains only Sector 1 with four complete walls and one continuously replaced NPC. Arcade, Arena, and Local PvP menu graphics are presentation-only and noninteractive.

Baseline desktop controls:

- **W** — forward thrust.
- **S** — counter-thrust/braking by accelerating opposite current velocity.
- **Mouse** — aim/rotate.
- **Left mouse button** — fire.

Controller face buttons dispatch distinct player intents:

- **A** — consume the current capsule stack.
- **X** — apply a Projectile level upgrade.
- **Y** — apply a Speed level upgrade.
- **B** — apply a Shield level upgrade.

Aim locks are player-owned. Missiles prefer their owner’s current valid lock, then use their own automatic fallback target. A different player’s lock cannot redirect them.

Keep these familiar asset locations stable unless asset migration is explicitly requested: `assets/player_ship.webp`, `assets/asteroid.webp`, `assets/projectile.webp`, `assets/space_background.webp`, and core audio under `assets/audio/`.

## 0) Rule Hierarchy

### Hard Rules

- Inspect the relevant code and tests before suggesting or making changes.
- Keep changes small, incremental, and testable.
- Do not duplicate authoritative gameplay state across systems.
- UI, rendering, camera, and audio must not own combat, progression, room membership, or match truth.
- Do not perform large refactors without explaining the concrete need and asking first.
- Preserve the shared `Player`, `Projectile`, hazard, collision-result, reward, and input contracts across modes.
- Adventure uses Sector 1 direct geometry and its established four-wall collision system; no other gameplay mode is launchable.
- Adventure is the sole runtime mode. Preserve shared RPG mechanics in Player, Projectile, Game, and physics seams.
- Online multiplayer is out of scope. `network_manager.js` is legacy and `Game.network` is intentionally `null` in the active build.
- For bugs involving hits, destruction, rewards, HP, shields, death, respawn, room transfer, or timing, inspect the owning gameplay path before patching HUD/menu/audio behavior.

### Strong Defaults

- Work in the smallest complete slice, normally one to three tightly related edits.
- Change the authoritative owner first, consuming logic second, presentation last.
- Classify changed data as authoritative, derived, indexed/accelerating, or presentation-only.
- Treat Experimental indexes as derived acceleration structures. Canonical arrays remain authoritative.
- Reuse `getWorldRules()` rather than adding mode checks throughout entity physics.
- Reuse `getArenaPopulationTargets()` for standard and Experimental density interpretation.
- Validate syntax and run the focused test file after JavaScript edits; run the broader suite when changing shared contracts.
- Do not introduce a framework or build-system change for an ordinary gameplay/UI slice.

### Soft Preferences

- Prefer readable, explicit data flow over clever abstractions.
- Preserve responsive controls and clear momentum feedback.
- Prefer named mode/world-rule seams over scattered string comparisons.
- Keep menu terminology aligned with the actual screens and modes.


### Zorka RPG shared mechanical contract

- Movement is aim-relative. Human movement coefficient is 1.0 and NPC movement coefficient is 0.8.
- Player owns its clip: Standard begins at 12, Projectile upgrades add 2, Laser derives at 50%, Orb derives at 33.333% using nearest-whole normalization, and empty reload takes 7 seconds.
- Player owns manual missile cooldown. Keyboard/mouse Player 1 fires with E; tiers use 13/9/5 seconds. No automatic missile firing or new controller binding.
- Ordinary projectiles use only their owner's valid live lock at 0.3 missile homing strength.
- Held primary fire discharges the clip at the established cadence without burst grouping.
- Adventure is playable, while shared runtime behavior remains in the shared owners rather than menu/rendering code.

## 1) Workflow Expectations

For refactor work, follow the evidence-gated process in
[`REFACTOR_WORKFLOW.md`](REFACTOR_WORKFLOW.md). In particular, reconcile the
current contract and establish a correctness baseline before selecting a
structural or performance change. Treat its candidate list as a re-rankable
backlog, not an approved roadmap.

### Default Approach

1. Inspect the smallest relevant code/test bundle.
2. Identify the authoritative owner and any derived indexes or presentation consumers.
3. Make the smallest complete edit.
4. Run a syntax/static check and focused tests where practical.
5. State expected in-game behavior and quick verification steps.

### Default Diagnostic Order

For gameplay defects, inspect in this order:

1. authoritative match/entity owner
2. update, collision, damage, or transition rule
3. spawn/composition/input path
4. derived indexes or world-rule selection
5. camera, HUD, audio, or menu presentation

For startup failures, begin with `main.js`, `game.js`, imports, `package.json`, and the browser console. Do not begin with CSS unless evidence points to overlay/input routing.

For Experimental defects, also trace:

**area definition → room membership/index → active-area filter → collision/render/audio consumer**

For hit/death/reward defects, trace:

**collision → `hitTarget` / `resolvePlayerDamage` → collection mutation/progression → respawn/replacement → VFX/audio/HUD**

## 2) Current Architecture Rules

### 2.1 Runtime Composition and Frame Flow

`main.js` creates `Game` on `window.load` and calls `game.start()`.

`Game` owns bootstrap, assets, screens/modes, match collections, input coordination, update/collision ordering, camera/HUD/audio composition, and cross-entity outcomes.

The practical frame order is:

1. Read keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
2. Update living players and NPC intent.
3. Update asteroids, hazards, projectiles, and effects.
4. Apply Experimental wall and room coordination when active.
5. Resolve collisions and authoritative outcomes.
6. Process death, Arcade reconciliation, respawns, and camera targets.
7. Render world, entities, HUD, menus, aim-lock feedback, and presentation effects.

### 2.2 State Ownership

| Owner | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `Game` (`game.js`) | Mode/screen state, canonical entity collections, arena options, spawning, collision outcomes, rewards, damage/death/respawn, Arcade wave state, Experimental session/rooms/doors/index coordination |
| `Player` (`entities/player.js`) | Position/velocity/aim, local/NPC control state, lock state, capsules, weapon/evolution state, XP/level upgrades, HP, shields/recharge, score/streak data |
| `Asteroid` (`entities/asteroid.js`) | Tier, movement, radius, rotation, hit/destruction state |
| `SpaceDebris` / `Satellite` (`entities/hazards.js`) | Hazard movement, hit state, XP identity, satellite firing cadence |
| `Projectile` (`entities/projectile.js`) | Position/velocity, lifespan, owner, distance cap, weapon flags, missile fallback target, orbital/tentacle state |
| `physics.js` | Stateless Newtonian, wrapping, collision, closest-point, swept-wall, slide, and reflection helpers |
| `world/experimental_rooms.js` | Immutable Experimental area topology, geometry, entrances, progression metadata, and collision categories |
| `camera.js` | Wrapped or direct/room camera transforms; no match truth |
| `ui/hud.js`, `audio_manager.js`, `index.html` | Presentation and intent dispatch only |

Do not mirror capsules, HP, shields, levels, room membership, active-area truth, or arena options in DOM attributes, HUD caches, audio state, or camera state.

### 2.3 State Categories

- **Authoritative state** — canonical live match/entity data that determines gameplay; one owner only.
- **Derived indexes** — Experimental per-area entity sets used to accelerate candidate lookup. They must reconcile with canonical arrays and never become an alternate source of truth.
- **Derived runtime state** — speed display, minimap coordinates, camera target, valid-lock visibility, population counts.
- **Presentation-only state** — menu focus, cursor art, overlay timing, VFX animation, audio playback.

UI may dispatch intent and read state; it must not grant rewards, resolve damage, transfer rooms, or apply mode rules.

### 2.4 Shared Gameplay Boundaries

- `Player` plus `physics.js` own Newtonian movement. Standard modes wrap; Experimental passes `worldRules.wrap === false` and lets wall coordination own boundaries.
- `Game.handleFire()` coordinates projectile insertion; `Player.fire()` defines weapon output.
- `Game.checkCollisions()`, `Game.hitTarget()`, and missile/AoE detonation methods own authoritative combat outcomes.
- `Game.resolvePlayerDamage()` resolves spawn immunity, shield consumption, HP loss, and confirmed death in that order.
- Base HP is five. XP level gains increase maximum and current HP by one.
- HP recharges to full after its configured delay; shields recharge one charge at a time according to Arena Options.
- Shield level upgrades add one maximum charge and grant one current charge.
- Respawn restores HP, movement state, brief immunity, and configured starting shield charges without erasing match-local shield capacity.
- Ordinary Normal, Antigun, and Double projectiles receive independent world-width travel caps. Lasers, missiles, and transformation-specific projectiles remain uncapped by that system.
- Asteroids remain lethal cover and split Large → Medium → Small.
- Debris and satellites grant configured XP but no capsules.
- Enemy ship kills grant a capsule and score/streak progression; NPC kills also grant XP based on NPC level.
- Death clears capsule/temporary weapon state. Hardcore rules also reset level progression.

### 2.5 Modes

#### Local PvP

Uses the standard wrapped world, shared arena populations, shared damage/progression systems, and normal respawn flow. Transformations are enabled. Solo Arena is unsupported; its menu graphic is presentation-only.

#### Arcade Mode

- Separate `ARCADE` game state with exactly four immutable outer walls and no wrapping.
- One human player with a random palette color.
- Transformations are disabled.
- Hardcore progression reset is always active.
- NPC waves scale as 1 level-1 bot, 2 level-2 bots, and so on through the eighth wave.
- After reaching eight concurrent NPCs, each replacement increases sequentially from level 9 onward.
- The human has one life; death produces the Arcade game-over summary instead of respawning.
- NPC deaths eliminate them and feed wave reconciliation.

#### Experimental Mode

- Separate `EXPERIMENTAL` game state and cleanup/session lifecycle.
- Nine full-size combat rooms connected by eight progression hallways and three persistent shortcut hallways.
- Combat room `n` owns `n` NPCs at level `n` and independently resolves the same Arena Options population targets.
- Hallways have no persistent population and purge transient environment/projectile state on human entry.
- Movement is bounded by thick wall segments rather than wrapped.
- Human ships may pass entrances and commit area membership after doorway clearance; NPCs and large bodies are confined/deflected; projectile representations terminate at blockers; small asteroids can be environmentally destroyed and replaced.
- Cross-room targeting, collision, blast, and spatial audio are filtered by current area, with narrow doorway adjacency exceptions for genuine human/environment contact. Selective simulation and rendering also include nearby combat rooms while a human is within the configured hallway activity depth.
- Canonical arrays remain authoritative; per-area indexes accelerate room-local queries.
- Rooms without a human skip expensive NPC targeting/firing, satellite shots, VFX updates, and spatial audio.
- Rendering includes active-area entities plus only current/connected-area walls intersecting the viewport, using a documented cull margin.
- Camera and minimap use direct room/area coordinates. Cleanup restores wrapped camera behavior for standard modes.
- Confirmed area transitions preserve temporary bonuses, shield state, and general progression.
- Experimental human death preserves profile progression, rebuilds run-scoped world state, and respawns the player at the center of Sector 1.

### 2.6 Arena Options

`Game` owns shared option values and application paths:

- asteroid density
- debris density
- satellite density
- starting shield charges
- shield recharge rate
- bot aggression
- hardcore mode
- cursor style and control presentation preferences

`getArenaPopulationTargets()` is the shared population resolver. Experimental applies those targets independently to every combat room; standard modes apply them globally.

### 2.7 Presentation Responsibilities

Use these terms consistently:

- Splash Screen
- Menu Screen
- Solo Arena Screen
- Local PvP Arena Screen
- Arcade Mode / Arcade Game Over
- Experimental Screen / Experimental Mode
- Options Screen / Arena Options
- In-game Pause Menu

`index.html` owns DOM layout and controls. `game.js` owns transitions and rules invoked by those controls. The pause menu floats over play and does not pause simulation.

## 3) File Inspection Heuristics

| Problem | Inspect first |
| --- | --- |
| Menu, mode buttons, screen transitions, Arena Options | `index.html`, `game.js`, then `main.js` |
| Thrust, braking, aim, controls, NPC motion | `entities/player.js`, `physics.js`, then `game.js` |
| Aim lock or missile targeting | `game.js`, `entities/projectile.js`, `entities/player.js` |
| Projectile output/travel cap | `entities/player.js`, `entities/projectile.js`, `game.js` |
| HP, shields, recharge, level upgrades | `entities/player.js`, `game.js`, `ui/hud.js` |
| Arcade waves/game over | `game.js`, Arcade DOM in `index.html`, `test/arena-leveling.test.js` |
| Experimental topology/population | `world/experimental_rooms.js`, `game.js`, Experimental tests |
| Experimental walls/doors/room transfer | `physics.js`, `world/experimental_rooms.js`, `game.js` |
| Experimental performance/culling | `game.js`, `camera.js`, `ui/hud.js`, performance/minimap tests |
| Asteroid tiers/collision | `entities/asteroid.js`, `physics.js`, `game.js` |
| Debris/satellite behavior/rewards | `entities/hazards.js`, `game.js`, `entities/projectile.js` |
| Audio/HUD incorrect after an event | authoritative event owner first, then `audio_manager.js` / `ui/hud.js` |
| Vite/import startup failure | `package.json`, `main.js`, `game.js`, browser console |

## 4) Code Change Output

When reporting a code change, include:

- file path
- method/section changed
- why it belongs at that ownership seam
- expected in-game behavior
- focused tests or quick debug checks

Provide exact replacements for small edits. Provide a full file only when edits span multiple regions or the user requests it.

After each completed slice, state what is complete, expected behavior, tests run, and likely failure points to check quickly.

## 5) Refactors

Suggest a refactor only when current structure blocks progress, the same ownership problem recurs, or shared/Experimental branches have become unsafe to maintain.

Before a broad refactor:

1. identify the concrete wrong seam
2. propose the smallest viable extraction
3. explain why an ordinary slice is insufficient
4. ask before implementing

Do not refactor for theoretical purity alone. In particular, do not extract Experimental indexes or world rules into alternate canonical state.

## 6) Gameplay Philosophy

Zorka is driven by intuitive Newtonian flight, momentum, tactical cover, risk/reward progression, and readable escalation.

Core loop:

- Fly with inertia and counter-thrust to brake.
- Fight ships and navigate lethal asteroid/hazard fields.
- Gain XP from hazards and NPCs; gain capsules from ship kills.
- Choose Projectile, Speed, or Shield level upgrades and spend capsule stacks on stronger temporary capabilities.
- Use spacing, angles, locks, cover, shields, and HP recovery to survive.

Mode-specific expression:

- Standard arenas emphasize reusable sandbox combat.
- Arcade emphasizes one-life escalating survival.
- Experimental emphasizes room progression, bounded spaces, doorway traversal, and room-local simulation.

Priority:

**clarity > cleverness**

**ownership > convenience**

**shared entity/rule contracts > mode forks**

**canonical state > derived indexes**

**incremental progress > large refactors**
